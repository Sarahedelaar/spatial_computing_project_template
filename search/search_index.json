The housing complex is to accommodate students, young graduates (starters), and elderly. The complex also provides communal/public facilities, almost as a collective.

The part that is to be changed is the big multi-functional building, but if required, the old railway line, football park, restaurant and green park in the light green areas can be incorporated as well. If the design is extended into the optional parts, any streets or pathways crossing this region should be integrated into the design, without losing their original function.

Noise pollution gets reduced once you get further away from the sound source. So this analysis is also calculated by means of the distance between a certain point and a voxel. Noise Sun access For this analysis we had to take the annual path of the sun. From the points of this path the sun shoots rays of light that hit the voxels. The more hits, the higher the sun accessibility. Sun accessibility Shadow casting Shadow casting extends the previous analysis, by inverting the hits with the sun. The inverted hits are the shadows that cast a shadow over surrounded buildings. Shadow casting Sky view factor In the sky view analysis we calculated the amount of a sky a voxel can see without being blocked by surrounded structures.

Every space has hidden paths making for a room that is walkable and usable. These paths are displayed in the center of the catalogue. Catalogue roadmap Below is a roadmap, designed for making a floor plan for any given space. It makes the plan based on the area given, this then gets converted into an amount of mini- and microvoxels. Then the furniture gets selected that is assigned to the type of space. After that the borders of the furniture are assigned. Neighbours are assigned. Assemble the floor plan, make sure there are no double hidden corridors to not waste space. Make the plan orthogonal.

Create documentation environment Now we need to create the appropriate environment for documenting by installing all the necessary tools. To do so we have provided you an environment droplet, which is a recipe for a series of installations that create the aforementioned environment. For that, after directing to the root folder of this project where the environment droplet ( environment.yml ) is located, you need to run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml Start Work on Documentation After finishing your work on documentation you need to shutdown the server and deactivate the environment. Activate the Environment Now that you have created the appropriate environment, you need to activate the environment to be able to work inside it. For that, as you are in the root folder of this project, you need to run the following command: conda activate spatial_computing_docs If the command line is now indicating the name of the environment in parenthesis, it means that the environment is activated. Similar to this ( spatial_computing_docs ) { your username } @ { your computer name } spatial_computing_project_template % Run the Local Server Now that the environment is activated, we need to run the local server to be able to see the result of changes in the local version of the documentation website. For that, run the following command: mkdocs serve After running this command, if the server has started to work successfully, you should see the following line in the command line: INFO - Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 This means that the server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . If you open your browser and go this link you should see a local version of the site. Writing Your Documentation In the documenting process you need to head to the docs folder and edit the .md (markdown) files, since the website is build from these files. In the root of this project, you can edit the configurations of your project in mkdocs.yml file: Adding o removing pages Add markdown extensions . Some of the useful extensions: arithmatex for writing mathematics highlight for code highlighting Customizing the looks of your documentation Adding MkDocs Plugins , such as: mknotebooks for including python notebooks in the documentations Finish Work on Documentation Server Shut Down To shutdown the server, you need to press Ctrl + C in the command line. The following should appear in the command line: INFO - Shutting down... Deactivate Environment After shutting down your server the command line is back to the normal state and you can run commands again. To deactivate your environment you need to run the following command: conda deactivate Deployment of the Documentation Site Build and Deploy to deploy your documentation website, you need to run the following command in the root of this repository: mkdocs gh-deploy This command will create a new branch in your repository called gh-pages and build your site in it. It will then push the new branch to your remote repository automatically. It will also create a site folder in your root directory containing all of your site files. Since this folder is added .gitignore file, it won't be committed or pushed to the remote repository. Setup GitHub Pages For the first time, you need to configure the GitHub Pages service on your GitHub repository so it wil automatically build your documentation website whenever you deploy your site. To do this: Go to your repository setting, got GitHub Pages section, select gh-pages branch, select /(root) location, click on the save button. The setting page will refresh, and now if you go to the address that is provided at the GitHub Pages section, Wola, here is your documentation!","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"documenting/instructions/#documenting-instructions","text":"","title":"Documenting Instructions"},{"location":"documenting/instructions/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"documenting/instructions/#install-conda","text":"You can install Anaconda or Miniconda to install conda package manager (if you don't know the difference you should install anaconda).","title":"Install Conda"},{"location":"documenting/instructions/#create-documentation-environment","text":"Now we need to create the appropriate environment for documenting by installing all the necessary tools.
